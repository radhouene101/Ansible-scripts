# what this basically does is ping other nodes through connecting to them with ssh using the path for ssh file that we specified 
#and -i for inventory and -m is specifying that we're using module ping
ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping

# to list all hosts
ansible all --list-hosts

#output all the system information for all hosts
ansible all -m  gather_facts
#output all information about specific host
ansible all -m gather_facts --limit 192.168.30.164
